# Weather Application
Weather application created on JavaScript. App uses OpenWeatherMap's API to fetch real-time data and allows users to search and view results for specific cities. Project runnable with Live Server extension.

## Technologies Used:

### JavaScript

JavaScript was used to retrieve and format data from API, display and visualize weather data for user, and listen to submission events and find data for specific cities. Specifically, async/await functions are used to validate user input and translate/retrieve JSON files from fetching data. Translation is necessary for data to be manipulated for display. More functions are used to format the structure of the UI, translate weather conditions from API to emojis, and handle/display errors for information beyond the bounds of API. 

### HTML

Created textbox and submit button, and card for CSS Styling and JS usage.

### CSS

Used for styling of card, buttons, fonts of information, hover and active changes, and overall layout.
